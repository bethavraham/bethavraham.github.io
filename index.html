                    </hgroup>
                    <p>Beth Avraham is a modern orthodox synagogue that combines traditional services with a very informal, easygoing atmosphere and small-town friendliness. We regularly combine Ashkenazi and Sephardi minhagim, and we welcome and our congregants come from every part of the globe. </p>
                        
                    <p>If you are Sephardi, Ashkenazi, Mizrachi, Bukharian, Syrian, or from any other tradition, and you want to lead a service according to your customs, we would be happy to have you! </p>
                    
                    <p>No one is ever made to feel unwelcome, and a position on the board is always reserved for a young congregant. The congregation is growing, new people are joining -- come see what all the excitement is about!</p>
