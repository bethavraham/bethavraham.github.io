                    <p>Beth Avraham is a modern orthodox synagogue that combines traditional services with a very informal, easygoing atmosphere and small-town friendliness. We regularly combine Ashkenazi and Sephardi minhagim, and we welcome and our congregants come from every part of the globe. </p>
                        
                    <p>If you are Sephardi, Ashkenazi, Mizrachi, Bukharian, Syrian, or from any other tradition, and you want to lead a service according to your customs, we would be happy to have you! </p>
                    
                    <p>No one is ever made to feel unwelcome, and a position on the board is always reserved for a young congregant. The congregation is growing, new people are joining -- come see what all the excitement is about!</p>

                    <p>The shul started out as Congregation Agudath Achim in late 1920 in the crowded back of David Millers' furniture store. On January 31, 1921, the certification of corporation was issued and it started to take off. For the next 45 years, it was a vibrant synagogue that offered the only Orthodox services in town to the Jewish residents of South Side Bethlehem on 437 Webster Street on the beginning of the South Mountain. In May 1965, it moved to the borough of Edgeboro which then became a part of Bethlehem. The building still has its original woodwork.</p>

                    <p>By the early '70s Bethlehem Steel and the congregation started to dwindle, and by 1977 there was no rabbi and the synagogue had declined. For about two decades, it was considered a closed facility. Preparations were made to dispose of the assets and it seemed that all was lost. Then, in September of 2003, Bob Trotner hired the shul's first rabbi in 25 years. By Passover 2004, there were several congregants consisting of mostly children, teens and young adults.</p>

                    <p>That Passover, the congregation was renamed Beth Avraham after its first rabbi, Rabbi Avraham Mowitz, who served this wonderful Synagogue with distinction for 30 years.</p>

                    <p>Today, the community is located near the Delaware River in Easton, PA, and led by Rabbi Yitzchok Yagod.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Yitzchok Yagod is both the rabbi and the president of Beth Avraham, an OU charter member shul. He is passionate about building a community where all types of Jews will find a warm welcome, as well as a high standard of study and learning of the Torah. Rabbi Yagod gives shiurim 5 nights a week, and often tells his congregants, "You should always leave the Shul with more than you came in with.”</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Yagod has studied under numerous prominent rabbis, both in yeshivas and one-on-one. He started out as a student in the Mir Yeshiva from 1976 to 1979, where he studied under Rav Chaim Shmulevitz. During his time at the Mir Yeshiva, Rabbi Yagod learned safrus and was ordained as a sofer (scribe) by the High Rabbinical Court of Yerushalayim in 1978. He then learned at the Brisk Yeshiva in Yerushalayim in 1979, where he studied under Rav Berel Soloveitchik. In 1980, Rabbi Yagod went to the Lakewood Yeshiva and later spent several years in a Chassidic Kollel.</p>

                    <p>He earned his first ordination, a Chassidic smicha, in 1983 from Rav S. L. Weinberger, a well-known Chassidic Rav in Brooklyn. Rabbi Yagod then learned one-on-one with HaRav Pinchas Hirschprung zt”l, the former Chief Rabbi of Canada, for 7 years, and received his advanced ordination for halachic rulings from HaRav Hirschprung in Montreal in March of 1995. Around this time, from 1992 to 1998, he served on the boards of the Yeshiva Gedola of Montreal, and of the girls’ school Beth Jacob in the same city. Shortly thereafter, beginning in 1999 and for the next 24 years, Rabbi Yagod was a student of the respected scholar HaRav Nota Greenblatt zt”l.</p>

                    <p>Currently, Rabbi Yagod is the head of a kashrus organization, EK Kosher, which he has been running since 2011. EK Kosher (Vaad HaKashrus of Eastern Canada and Maine, website: easternkosher.com) is on the official accepted cRc list. In addition to running his own organization, he works for numerous kosher agencies, including the OU, OK, Star K, Chuf K, cRc, MK, COR, KVH, Earth Kosher, and several Chassidic agencies. He is a member of the OU/RCA, the OU, and AKO.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Yagod is the scion of a rabbinical family. His father is a noted Talmud Chachum, as well as an expert in Gemarrah who has written scholarly books on advanced Gemarrah discussion. Rabbi Yagod's brother is a world-famous Rosh Yeshivah, and his entire family is very well-learned in Torah. Halacha and Gemarrah are Rabbi Yagod's home, and he has written Halachic Teshuvos.</p>

                    <p>Ever multitalented, Rabbi Yagod also worked for years in the field of computer science. He received his bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1986, as well as an engineering degree and certification for enterprise-wide networks in 1997.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Pinchus is a traveling kosher supervisor who loves to talk Torah with anyone who is curious. He has a huge love and passion for music and adores music in almost every form. He particularly loves Jewish music and specializes in singing Jewish songs of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Pinchus has been a chazzan for as long as he can remember! He started out leading services at the age of 6 or 7 at times when there was no minyan. He unofficially held the position of chazzan for many years in Moncton, New Brunswick, as well as in Easton on several occasions. He has also been a guest chazzan in two synagogues in Maine, several synagogues in Brooklyn, a synagogue in Texas, and two synagogues in Colombia.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Pinchus has been a rabbi since 2021. He was certified by Rabbi Aryeh Leib Zell, the head of his yeshiva, Beis Hillel of Kensington Brooklyn, and by Rabbi Howard Katzenstein, a rabbi from the OU.</p>

                    <p>He appreciates the chance to learn about different world cultures and different Jewish cultures. He has traveled to more than half of the United States, Canada, and Colombia. He has experience with various ultra-orthodox, Lithuanian, Chasidic, Sephardic, Modern Orthodox, German, Israeli, and American Jewish cultures and communities.</p>

                    <p>He has a fascination with psychology and dabbles in geography, as well.</p>

                    <p>Upon graduation from Moravian University in 1973, Bob worked at a series of jobs for the Social Security Administration. He graduated from law school in 1986, became a lawyer locally, and was elected president of the shul in the 1990s.</p>

                    <p>Rabbi Yagod arrived in 2004, the answer to Bob’s two-decade prayer for a rabbi for the shul. He is proud to have worked side by side with Rabbi Yagod to rejuvenate the shul.</p>

                    <p>Bob is now retired and takes advantage of the synagogue services and the many shiurim and learning opportunities. He also enjoys chess and reading novels.</p>

                    <p>Bob’s maternal grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Abba Mowitz, his grandmother, Rebbitzen Rifka Mowitz, and their four children – arrived in 1923 from Lithuania. His mother was born in Bethlehem in 1924, and his grandfather served as rabbi until his death in 1950. Bob and his brother were born into the shul in 1951, and his sister in 1957.</p>
