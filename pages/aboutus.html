                    </hgroup>
                    <p>The shul started out as Congregation Agudath Achim in late 1920 in the crowded back of David Millers' furniture store. On January 31, 1921, the certification of corporation was issued and it started to take off. For the next 45 years, it was a vibrant synagogue that offered the only Orthodox services in town to the Jewish residents of South Side Bethlehem on 437 Webster Street on the beginning of the South Mountain. In May 1965, it moved to the borough of Edgeboro which then became a part of Bethlehem. The building still has its original woodwork.</p>

                    <p>By the early '70s Bethlehem Steel and the congregation started to dwindle, and by 1977 there was no rabbi and the synagogue had declined. For about two decades, it was considered a closed facility. Preparations were made to dispose of the assets and it seemed that all was lost. Then, in September of 2003, Bob Trotner hired the shul's first rabbi in 25 years. By Passover 2004, there were several congregants consisting of mostly children, teens and young adults.</p>

                    <p>That Passover, the congregation was renamed Beth Avraham after its first rabbi, Rabbi Avraham Mowitz, who served this wonderful Synagogue with distinction for 30 years.</p>

                    <p>Today, the community is located near the Delaware River in Easton, PA, and led by Rabbi Yitzchok Yagod.</p>
